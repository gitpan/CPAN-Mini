=head1 NAME

CPAN::Mini - create a minimal mirror of CPAN

=head1 VERSION

version 0.37_01

 $Id: Mini.pm,v 1.18 2005/01/06 23:40:22 rjbs Exp $

=head1 SYNOPSIS

(If you're not going to do something weird, you probably want to look at the
L<minicpan> command, instead.)

 use CPAN::Mini;

 CPAN::Mini->update_mirror(
   remote => "http://cpan.mirrors.comintern.su",
   local  => "/usr/share/mirrors/cpan",
   trace  => 1
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CPAN::Mini provides a simple mechanism to build and update a minimal mirror of
the CPAN on your local disk.  It contains only those files needed to install
the newest version of every distribution.  Those files are:

=over 4

=item * 01mailrc.txt.gz

=item * 02packages.details.txt.gz

=item * 03modlist.data.gz

=item * the last non-developer release of every dist for every author

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<< update_mirror( %args ) >>

 CPAN::Mini->update_mirror(
   remote => "http://cpan.mirrors.comintern.su",
   local  => "/usr/share/mirrors/cpan",
   force  => 0,
   trace  => 1
 );

This is the only method that need be called from outside this module.  It will
update the local mirror with the files from the remote mirror.   

If called as a class method, C<update_mirror> creates an ephemeral CPAN::Mini
object on which other methods are called.  That object is used to store mirror
location and state.

This method returns the number of files updated.

The following options are recognized:

=over 4

=item * C<dirmode>

Generally an octal number, this option sets the permissions of created
directories.  It defaults to 0711.

=item * C<force>

If true, this option will cause CPAN::Mini to read the entire module list and
update anything out of date, even if the module list itself wasn't out of date
on this run.

=item * C<skip_perl>

If true, CPAN::Mini will skip the major language distributions: perl, parrot,
and ponie.

=item * C<trace>

If true, CPAN::Mini will print status messages to STDOUT as it works.

=item * C<errors>

If true, CPAN::Mini will warn with status messages on errors.  (default: true)

=item * C<path_filters>

This options provides a set of rules for filtering paths.  If a distribution
matches one of the rules in C<path_filters>, it will not be mirrored.  A regex
rule is matched if the path matches the regex; a code rule is matched if the
code returns 1 when the path is passed to it.  For example, the following
setting would skip all distributions from RJBS and SUNGO:

 path_filters => [
   qr/RJBS/,
   sub { $_[0] =~ /SUNGO/ }
 ]

=item * C<module_filters>

This options provides a set of rules for filtering modules.  It behaves like
path_filters, but acts only on module names.  (Since most modules are in
distributions with more than one module, this setting will probably be less
useful than C<path_filters>.)  For example, this setting will skip any
distribution containing only modules with the word "Acme" in them:

 module_filters => [ qr/Acme/i ]

=item * C<skip_cleanup>

If this option is true, CPAN::Mini will not try delete unmirrored files when it
has finished mirroring

=head2 C<< _filter_module({ module => $foo, version => $foo, path => $foo }) >>

This internal-only method encapsulates the logic where we figure out if a
module is to be mirrored or not. Better stated, this method holds the filter
chain logic. C<update_mirror()> takes an optional set of filter parameters.  As
C<update_mirror()> encounters a distribution, it calls this method to figure
out whether or not it should be downloaded. The user provided filters are taken
into account. Returns 1 if the distribution is filtered (to be skipped).
Returns 0 if the distribution is to not filtered (not to be skipped).

=head2 C<< file_allowed($file) >>

This method returns true if the given file is allowed to exist in the local
mirror, even if it isn't one of the required mirror files.

By default, only dot-files are allowed.

=cut

	my ($self, $file) = @_;

	return (substr(basename($file),0,1) eq '.') ? 1 : 0;

=head2 C<< clean_unmirrored >>

This method finds any files in the local mirror which are no longer needed and
calls the C<clean_file> method on them.

=cut

sub clean_unmirrored {
	my $self = shift;

	find sub {
		my $file = canonpath($File::Find::name);
		$self->clean_file($file);
	}, $self->{local};
}

=head2 C<< clean_file($filename) >>

This method, called by C<clean_unmirrored>, checks whether the named file
exists.  If it exists, and was not mirrored, and C<file_allowed> doesn't say it
can stay, the file is deleted.

=cut

sub clean_file {
	my ($self, $file) = @_;

	return unless (-f $file and not $self->{mirrored}{$file});
	return if $self->file_allowed($file);

    return;
  }
	$self->trace("$file ... removed\n");
}

=head2 C<< trace( $message, $force ) >>

If the object is mirroring verbosely, this method will print messages sent to
it.  If CPAN::Mini is not operating in verbose mode, but C<$force> is true, it
will print the message anyway.

=cut

sub trace {
	my ($self, $message, $force) = @_;
	print "$message" if $self->{trace} or $force;
}

=head1 THANKS

Thanks to David Dyck for letting me know about my stupid documentation errors.

Thanks to Roy Fulbright for finding an obnoxious bug on Win32.

Thanks to Shawn Sorichetti for fixing a stupid octal-number-as-string bug.

Thanks to sungo for implementing the filters, so I can finally stop mirroring
bioperl, and Robert Rothenberg for suggesting adding coderef rules.
